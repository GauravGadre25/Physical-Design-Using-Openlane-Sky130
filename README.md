# Physical-Design-Using-Openlane-Sky130
This repository contains all the information included in the Advanced Physics Design Using OpenLANE / Sky 130 workshop. This workshop helped me in learning ASIC implementation steps from RTL to GDSII flow using open source EDA tools and Google – Skywater technology PDK. The workshop was organized by VLSI System Design (VSD) corp.
